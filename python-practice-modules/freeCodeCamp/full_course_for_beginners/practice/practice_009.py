# def say_hi():
#     print("Hello user")

# say_hi()

# one defines the function, everything within the indentation is part of the function
# function doesn't do anything but itself, one needs to call it
# just by typing the name of the function with () is good to work

# def say_hi():
#     print("Hello user")


# print("Top")
# say_hi()
# print("Bottom")

# example showing order of operation in between print commands

# def say_hi(name):
#     print("Hello " + name)


# say_hi("Omar")
# say_hi("Charlotte")


# We can also state parameters within the function to follow when asked within the ()


def say_hi(name, age):
    print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.")


say_hi("Omar", "35")

# We can also add various variables within the function and call them up when requesting information
