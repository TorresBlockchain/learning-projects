# Exercise in Mad Libs Game

# print("Roses are red")
# print("Violets are blue")
# print("I love you")

# In order to have the user name play along, we'll have to change the code into the following


color = input("Enter a color: ")
plural_noun = input("Enter a plural noun: ")
celebrity = input("Enter a celebrity: ")


# print("Roses are {color}")
# print("{plural_noun} are blue")
# print("I love {celebrity}")

# the above is a good way to make reference notes while designating the variables to input into the program

print("Roses are " + color)
print(plural_noun + " are blue")
print("I love " + celebrity)
