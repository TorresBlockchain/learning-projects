# Lecture on looping over lists

# letters = ["a", "b", "c"]
# for letter in letters:
#     print(letter)


letters = ["a", "b", "c"]
for index, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print(index, letter)

# here we can break down the lists and create a tuple and be able to see which index each letter its assigned to
