# Lesson for loops

# for number in range(3):
#    print("Attempt", number + 1, (number + 1) * ".")

# by updating the range within the paranthesis, we can remove the '+1' within the argument

# for number in range(1, 4):
#    print("Attempt", number, number * ".")

# by changing the range from 4 to 10 and adding a step factor within range to change the output requested

for number in range(1, 10, 2):
    print("Attempt", number, number * ".")
